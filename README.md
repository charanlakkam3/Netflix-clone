Netflix Clone

Project Overview
This is a Netflix Clone webpage that replicates the basic structure and layout of the official Netflix homepage. It is developed using HTML and CSS to mimic the user interface. The purpose of this project is to enhance skills in frontend web development by recreating a modern, responsive, and visually appealing web page layout.

Features
Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.

Navigation Bar: A simple and clean navigation bar that includes the Netflix logo, search bar, and user account icon.

Hero Section: A full-width banner featuring popular shows, including a play button and detailed description.
Showcase Section: Multiple rows of movies/shows divided into categories, similar to Netflix’s original interface.

Hover Effects: Interactive hover effects on the movies/shows, displaying additional information like title and genre.

Footer: Includes links to social media, terms of service, and other important information, similar to Netflix’s footer section.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Styling, layout, responsiveness, hover effects, etc.
Flexbox & Grid: For responsive and flexible layouts.
Google Fonts: Used for custom fonts to match Netflix’s typography.

Features to Improve
JavaScript: Add interactivity for better user experience, such as carousels or dynamically loading content.
Backend Integration: Future enhancement could include connecting to a backend to dynamically load content or integrate user authentication.
